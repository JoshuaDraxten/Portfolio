    <i>tl;dr: Problem solving has been my passion for a long time, so thats what I want to do with my life</i>
    <p>
      The thing that sparked my passion for the world of computers was something called conway&#8217;s game of life.
      It&#8217;s a relatively simple program that simulates cells that are either <q>dead</q> or <q>alive</q>.
      The concept behind this program is so simple, yet somehow it makes enormously complex systems.
      With this as my starting point at a young age, I have always been facinated by the idea of simplicity giving rise to complex and useful systems.

      I found python at age 8 with the google search <q>Easiest programming languages to learn</q>(Probably after a few spell-correcting Did you means).
      I spent many afternoons tweaking my little projects, my <q>Little Frankensteins</q>.
      At age twelve I was making games with adobe flash, creating chatbots and other AI related projects and even designing my own 2-bit CPU.

      For the past three years, my learning emphasis has been on web development.
      I have used HTML, Javascript, CSS and jQuery in countless projects ranging from toy compilers, websites for local businesses and mobile apps.
      I&#8217;ve also been spending a lot of time teaching myself mathematics currently I am almost half way through [link: linear algebra done wrong] having compleated Calc I and Calc II.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am looking to start a career doing what I love: finding simple solutions to big problems.
      If you can help me with that goal or would just like to say hello feel free to email me at JoshuaDraxten@live.com.

        <p>
          Existentialistic ideas came out of a time in society when there was a deep sense of despair following the Great Depression and World War II.
          There was a spirit of optimism in society that was destroyed by World War I and its mid-century calamities.
          This despair has been articulated by existentialist philosophers well into the 1970s and continues on to this day as a popular way of thinking and reasoning
          (with the freedom to choose oneâ€™s preferred moral belief system and lifestyle).
        </p>
        <p>
          An existentialist could either be a religious moralist, agnostic relativist, or an amoral atheist.
          Kierkegaard, a religious philosopher, Nietzsche, an anti-Christian,
          Sartre, an atheist, and Camus an atheist, are credited for their works and writings about existentialism.
          Sartre is noted for bringing the most international attention to existentialism in the 20th century.

        <p>
          Each basically agrees that human life is in no way complete and fully satisfying because
          of suffering and losses that occur when considering the lack of perfection, power, and control one has over their life.
          Even though they do agree that life is not optimally satisfying, it nonetheless has meaning.
          Existentialism is the search and journey for true self and true personal meaning in life.

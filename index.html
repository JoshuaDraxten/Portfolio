    <i>tl;dr: Problem solving has been my passion for a long time, so thats what I want to do with my life</i>
    <p>
      The thing that sparked my passion for the world of computers was something called conway&#8217;s game of life.
      It&#8217;s a relatively simple program that simulates cells that are either <q>dead</q> or <q>alive</q>.
      The concept behind this program is so simple, yet somehow it makes enormously complex systems.
      With this as my starting point at a young age, I have always been fascinated by the idea of simplicity giving rise to complex and useful systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found python at age 8 with the google search <q>Easiest programming languages to learn</q>(Probably after a few spell-correcting Did you means).
      I spent many afternoons tweaking my little projects, my <q>Little Frankensteins</q>.
      At age twelve I was making games with adobe flash, creating chatbots and other AI related projects and even designing my own 2-bit CPU.

    <p>
      For the past three years, my learning emphasis has been on web development.
      I have used HTML, Javascript, CSS and jQuery in countless projects ranging from toy compilers, websites for local businesses and mobile apps.
      I&#8217;ve also been spending a lot of time teaching myself mathematics currently I am almost half way through [link: linear algebra done wrong] having completed Calc I and Calc II.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am looking to start a career doing what I love: finding simple solutions to big problems.
      If you can help me with that goal or would just like to say hello feel free to email me: <a href="mailto:joshuadraxten@live.com" target="_top">JoshuaDraxten@live.com</a>.

    <p>
      It&#8217;s fascinating how the success of the mobile sites stem from filling one particular niche.
      I was interested in how this affects designing mobile websites as opposed to desktop websites.
      So after taking extensive notes on both Google and Apple&#8217;s design philosophies, I set out to create my own project that worked smoothly with both ecosystems.
    </p>
    <p>
      First things first: I needed something to make.
      Something with a niche. The idea didn&#8217;t necessarily have to be good, just clear and concise.
      So I wrote a bunch of ideas down and explained their basic function.
      I used what I call "the Twitter test" to decide behind the ideas.
      I picked between the ideas that took 140 characters or less to explain exactly what the project would accomplish.
      The winner was:

  My favorite thing about material design is the metaphor behind it, that objects on a screen aren &#8217;t made of pixels but of actual material.
  I felt like this was a good starting point so I used Google&#8217;s polymer project.
  But I made sure to pay attention to how everything looked on the apple ecosystem.
  In order for it not to look clumsy, I restricted the different z-indexes to 3, which is the threshold that I saw on most iOS apps.

    <h2 id="articleTitle">Telling Stories</h2>

    <p>
      People digest information better through stories; they enjoy it better too.
      I bring this up because my portfolio is all about my story.
      You&#8217;re here because you want to know information about me, most likely my ability to perform different tasks.
      It&#8217;s my job to show you this, and it&#8217;s my opportunity to generate FOMO on what I will be able to do for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as any story, mine has central ideas, I wanted the overall UX to reflect that as well.
      As such, I designed the central themes of this website before I started to design it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I am simple, the user understands me  </li>
      <li>I am a puzzle, the user solves me     </li>
      <li>I am fun, the user plays with me      </li>
      <li>I am a story, the user reads me       </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    I believe the most important job of the UI is letting the user know where they are and where they can go from there.
    The simplicity allows for you to recognize where you are right away, the puzzle helps shuffle the user&#8217;s position,
    the fun attracts the user&#8217;s attention to their options and the story leaves an impression on the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote all major code in 8 hours(broken up), the remaining time was a loop of feedback from people I know and me writing the sections.

    <p>
      Exploration is the key to discovery, and I am constantly exploring.
      With the advent of sites like CodePen, I can now share even my small explorations.
      If you want to see me make things for the sake of curiosity like an <a target="_blank" href="http://codepen.io/JoshuaDraxten/pen/sjiJu">animated japaneese flag written entirely in kanji</a>
      or something like my <a target="_blank" href="http://codepen.io/JoshuaDraxten/pen/LVgGVO">BF compiler in CoffeeScript</a> for irony then <a target="_blank" href="http://codepen.io/JoshuaDraxten/popular/">follow me on CodePen</a>.
      I&#8217;m always exploring something new! New things like my mini-game based on a misunderstanding of anti-gravity: the farther away you are the stronger the pull of gravity.
